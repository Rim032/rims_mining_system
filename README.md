## [RMS] Rim's Mining System

### Purpose

This mod for GMod adds ores, unmined rocks and an ore dealer to mine and sell ores for the player to generate profit. This can be used for both serious and non-serious roleplay servers with adjustable values for both mining and selling.

### Reason

I wanted to practice more Lua while making a general purpose addon
that DarkRP servers can use.

### Misc.

Note: If there are any bugs/issue please let me know.
