**[RHS] Rim's Hit System

*Purpose

This mod for GMod is meant to replicate a more realistic damage system, than the default one, in which each part of the body takes different amounts of damage.
 For example, the head will receive more damage than a leg when shot.

*Reason

I wanted to practice more Lua while making a general purpose addon
that any server could use.

*Misc.

Note: If there are any bugs/issue please let me know.
